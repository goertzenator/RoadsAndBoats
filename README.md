## Map Presets ##
When the in-game Map Setup Assistant starts, it downloads the list of map presets located in `setup_assistant_presets.json`.  By adding to this file in github, all users will see new presets without having to change the mod in the Steam Workshop.  If you want a preset added please submit a pull request.
